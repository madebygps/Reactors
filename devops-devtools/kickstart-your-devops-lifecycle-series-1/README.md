# Kickstart Your DevOps Lifecycle Series 1

This is a series all about DevOps. Building, testing, deploying and iterating!

Attendees will learn how to create an application, containerise it and automate the manual steps involved in the deployment using readily available Azure services.

Key Technologies involved:

- Golang
- Docker / Podman
- Azure Container Registry
- Azure App Services
- GitHub
- GitHub Actions
- Git

## [Action for Developers](https://aka.ms/DevOpsLDNCSC)

In this challenge, we are covering key DevOps concepts to help bring containerisation, IaC, CI/CD pipelines and version control to your development. Throughout the series videos, we have provided step-by-step guidance to show how easy adding value to your development is. Complete these learn modules to skill up and try it yourself!

Feb 15 2022 | **[Automate Container Deployments Using GitHub Actions](https://aka.ms/LDNDevOpsSeries1)** <br><br>Step by Step episode introducing Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) demonstrating how to remove manual steps from application deployments and utilise automation tools with GitHub Actions. | [MeetUp](https://www.meetup.com/Microsoft-Reactor-London/events/283261014/) | [Microsoft Reactor YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfWvEwQUnD8&t=2305s)      
Feb 22 2022 | **[Automate Infrastructure creation with Terraform (IaC)](https://aka.ms/LDNDevOpsSeries1)** <br><br>In this session of the series we will recap on the project, the technologies used and then we will dive into some Infrastructure as Code (IaC). We will look at how to automate the creation of the cloud services that were previously manually created. To do this we will be using Terraform and exploring other options available in the market. | [MeetUp](https://www.meetup.com/Microsoft-Reactor-London/events/283529915/) | [Microsoft Reactor YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1x4TDOfvjA&t=799s)
